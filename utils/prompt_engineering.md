🎨 Prompt Engineering Guide for Text-to-Image Models

This guide explains how to write prompts that produce high-quality, detailed, and aesthetically pleasing images.

🧱 1. Structure of a Good Prompt

A strong prompt often includes:

Subject

Style / Art Direction

Details

Lighting

Camera / Composition (optional)

Environment / Background

Quality keywords

Example Structured Prompt:
a futuristic city skyline at sunset, photorealistic, ultra-detailed, warm cinematic lighting, 
8K resolution, wide-angle lens, sharp focus, reflective glass buildings, dramatic composition

🎭 2. Style Keywords

Use these to change the image style:

Photorealistic
photorealistic, ultra-detailed, sharp focus, realistic textures, 35mm lens

Cartoon / Anime
cartoon style, cel-shaded, bold outlines, vivid colors, anime lighting

Oil Painting
oil painting, canvas texture, visible brush strokes, classical art

Cyberpunk
cyberpunk neon lighting, futuristic city, dark contrast, reflective surfaces

Van Gogh / Artistic
in the style of Van Gogh, swirling brush strokes, vivid color palette

⚠️ 3. Negative Prompts (Remove Unwanted Artifacts)

Use negative prompts to avoid errors like deformations, blurriness, noise, or watermarks.

Common Negative Prompts:

blurry, low quality, distorted, bad anatomy, disfigured, mutated hands, 
extra limbs, watermark, text, grainy, low resolution, cropped, poorly drawn

💡 4. Quality Boost Keywords

Add these for significantly better images:

4K, 8K, ultra-detailed, hyperrealistic, volumetric lighting,
sharp focus, dramatic lighting, cinematic, professional photography,
high resolution, highly detailed textures

📸 5. Camera / Lens Keywords (Optional but Powerful)
35mm lens, f/1.8, shallow depth of field, bokeh, wide-angle shot,
studio lighting, overhead lighting, rim light

🌌 6. Environment Keywords
sunset glow, neon reflections, cloudy sky, mist, fog, fireflies,
forest background, futuristic cityscape, medieval castle

🧪 7. Example High-Quality Prompts
1. Photorealistic
a majestic lion standing on a rock, photorealistic, ultra-detailed fur,
golden hour lighting, 8K quality, sharp focus

2. Cartoon
a cute robot holding a flower, cartoon style, bold colors, clean outlines,
soft lighting

3. Van Gogh Style
a village under starry night sky, in the style of Van Gogh,
swirling brush strokes, rich textures

🧠 8. Best Practices

✔ Be specific
✔ Include style + lighting + details
✔ Add high-quality keywords
✔ Use negative prompt for removing artifacts
✔ Use smaller image size for CPU
✔ Use 20–30 steps for faster generation
✔ Add seed for reproducible outputs
